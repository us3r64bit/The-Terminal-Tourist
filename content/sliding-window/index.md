## Introduction

Sliding window technique is use for reducing some redundant calculation which slow down program. like it can reduce time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) with O(1) space complexity.

## Why use  it?
First of all it reduce time coplexity and also with O(1) space complexity. so let's understand with Example..
So we want to find maximum sum of k consecutive integer from array, so brute force would look like this for k=5,
 

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    vector<int> arr = {5,2,6,7,7,3,2,1,3,9};
    int final_max = 0;
    for(int i=0;i<arr.size()-5;i++){
        int temp_max = 0;
        for(int j=i;j<i+5;j++){
            temp_max += arr[j];
        }
        if(temp_max>final_max){
            final_max = temp_max;
        }
    }
    cout << final_max << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
But time complexity of above program is O(nk)

 **Brute Force Approach**

As per we can see in above image brute approach checks every patter of k length(here k=5). if you compare above code with this image you will understand it.here k=5 so it won't make too much different in O(n) and O(nk) but what if k is too big. then it will impact running time of program, so what to do now? can we implement this above code to O(n)?

Answer is YES!! , with use of sliding window we can reduce time complexity of above code O(n). 
 
## How Sliding Window Works?
So let's see how sliding window works.
let me give you simple visual with small array,

```js
    {5,2,6,7,7,3,2,1,3,9}
    for k=3 (because k=5 is too much to write)
    {5,2,6} --> first 3 elements
    {2,6,7} --> remove 5 and add 7 
    {6,7,7} --> remove 2 and add 7
    {7,7,3} --> remove 6 and add 3
    {7,3,2} --> remove 7 and add 2
    {3,2,1} --> remove 7 and add 1
    {2,1,3} --> remove 3 and add 3
    {1,3,9} --> remove 2 and add 9
```
let's understand with second example,
```js
    {5, 7, 1, 4, 3, 6, 2, 9, 2}
    k=5
    {5,7,1,4,3} --> first 5
    {7,1,4,3,6} --> remove 5 and add 6
    and so on.
```

As we can see in above image it move one step at one time. so this is how actually it works.
## Let's Code
Code for maximum sum of k consecutive integer from array, using sliding window technique.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int sum_of_k_ele(vector<int> arr,int k){
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i=0;i<k;i++){
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    return sum;
}
int main(){
    vector<int> arr = {5,2,6,7,7,3,2,1,3,9};
    int k=3;
    // below function will be used only once 
    // for finding sum of first k digits
    int final_sum = sum_of_k_ele(arr,k);
    
    int temp_sum = final_sum;
    for (int i=k;i<arr.size();i++){
        temp_sum = temp_sum - arr[i-k];
        temp_sum = temp_sum + arr[i];
        if(temp_sum>final_sum){
            final_sum = temp_sum;
        } 
    }
    cout << final_sum << endl;

    return 0;
}

``` 
## When to use?

- When you are looking for subrange in given string or array like highest or smallest value or targeted value.
- it involves data structure which is iterable like string or array.
- when there can be brute force solution with O(n^2) or (2^n)
