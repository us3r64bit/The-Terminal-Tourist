Yo, welcome to new blog post where I don't know what i do and I just fuck around with new things which seems pretty cool to me.
so in today's blog post we're going to deep dive into mind of memers(those fucker are everywhere) and how this [pump.fun](https://pump.fun/board) works.
Also You might want to grab a liter of coffee before we start because we're going deep, and I mean deeper than that weird part of Stack Overflow you stumble into at 3 AM. Oh, and if you're planning on powering through this in one sitting, do your ass a favor and take breaks. I don't want to be responsible for your hemorrhoids, wakatta?\
> Spoiler: I f*cked up, I thought of writing very detailed blog post but lost motivation because this blog got some bugs and while solving them, I got annoyed and cut down the blog post to 1/3 of the original(which I had planned of writing) blog post. but don't worry I've added links for some parts which I wanted to explain but couldn't

*Note: This is all about memes so if you're not comfortable with memes then fuck off.*

Now as you might have already lost half of your eye sight, you'll see some weird looking website.(website itself feel like meme 😉)

### First of all, let me tell you what we cover today:

=> WTH is pump.fun\
=> Little History\
=> Why does it exists\
=> How to Launch token on it to make 💰(because it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga" target="_blank">Kali Yuga</a> and we want money)\
=> What's next with my token\
=> How does it works\
=> How does pump.fun makes 💰(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga" target="_blank">Kali Yuga</a> they also want money)\
=> pros & cons\
=> personal thoughts

### So, What is pump.fun?

Pump.fun is a Solana-based platform that allows users to easily create and trade their own memecoins. It offers a user-friendly interface and low costs, making it accessible for both crypto enthusiasts and newcomers.

#### Now you might say, blah blah blah copied from the internet again 😮‍💨

Ok ok calm down, you know I always wanted to create a random coin like ******(*you might be not 18+*) and I couldn't because
it is "little" lenghty process to create your coin and if it has some weird word people can hate you but now with pump.fun there are other psychos like you too so no worries(just kidding).

jokes aside. pump.fun is zerodha/binance of *meme coins* and you can be creator of new **meme-coin** or you can trade existing coins with ease. 

![Meme Coin](/assets/What-the-hell-is-pump-dot-fun/meme-coin-idea.png)

So if you want to create your own crypto coin with your granny's name you can in literally less than 2 minutes(the same time you last during...)

Now you might have basic understanding of what is pump.fun right? if not don't worry you'll understand, just continue reading.

### A Little History

Actually I shouldn't even use word "History" because pump.fun started on **January 2024**(Yes that's not typo)
and it has quickly gained popularity in the crypto community.

Picture this: It's January 2024. The crypto winter is thawing, and the degens are getting restless. Enter Pump.fun, the lovechild of some mad geniuses who thought, "Hey, what if we made a platform where people could throw money at memes without getting completely rekt?"
Initially, Pump.fun was all about that Solana life. Why? Because apparently, someone decided that transactions should be faster than your ex ghosting you after "borrowing" your Ledger.

by April, the Pump.fun devs were probably hopped up on enough caffeine to realize, "Hey, what about all those Ethereum freaks?"
(*people who pays 50$ gas fees*)

Pump.fun was bootstrapped by Alliance DAO, a group of VCs who apparently looked at the dumpster fire that is memecoin trading and thought, "Yeah, let's throw some gasoline on that." And you know what? It worked. Pump.fun started printing money faster than your favorite Danny Daniels.

There are few reasons why people love pump.fun.\
-> user(memer)-friendly interface\
-> low fees\
-> Anti scam Measures\
-> Bonding Curve Model(keep reading for understanding this jargon)

### Why does it exist?

As I told you this Yug is called Kali Yug and we humans are stupid and we like stupid things(actually it's not stupid at all, it's fun, I just found out <a href="https://pump.fun/3A6a9ddBwLRrBP5nv92gVPYGDQJhDwc9BxkQrT3Hu6rj" target="_blank">Sol CEO Coin</a>, isn't it cute? sorry I just couldn't control 🥹 I'm human too)\
Also if you think this is stupid then you haven't heard about people who thinks *moon landing is fake* **and** *earth is flat*.

Ok lemme get back to point, so if some developer wants to create a crypto token, developer will be able to figure out things and will eventually manage to figure out some way to create it but what about regular humans?\
(*we also want regular humans to loose there money in crypto too. right?*)

👉 you can checkout <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=befUVytFC80" target="_blank">Creat you own crypto (The Developer way) [Optional]</a>

So developer or non-developer you can create your crypto token on pump.fun with just few clicks.(don't worry I'll explain how to in next section)

#### Now you might say, okay I got the basic idea about what pump.fun is, now I want to earn f***ing money so tell me how to create tokens fast.

Calm down Big boy.

***in English: Haste makes waste***

### How to Launch token and make 💰

If you just click on "How it works"(probably at top left corner) it will show you something like this,
![How it works](/assets/What-the-hell-is-pump-dot-fun/how-it-works.png)

now let's create our token. got to "Start a new coin" or click <a href="https://pump.fun/create" target="_blank">here</a> you lazy ass.\
and connect your wallet if you haven't 🤷 (it'll be probably on top right corner)\
and now fill the details of your token.
![Create big things](/assets/What-the-hell-is-pump-dot-fun/create-coin-page.png)  
*As I'm unemployed and broke, I can't click on that 😔*
You'll need to Pay a small fee of about **0.02 SOL** to deploy your token.\
(*small fee for people with job* 🥲)

Now sit tight because I'll throw a lot of jargons.

After smashing the "Create coin" button you'll probably have this popup.
![Create big things](/assets/What-the-hell-is-pump-dot-fun/you-buy-token-page.png)
***Of course, you'll buy your own coin, right?***

So you might have multiple questions like,

=> Should I buy my token or not?🤔\
=> What is the initial supply of the token?🤔\
=> How much should I buy?🤔\
=> What if I buy it all?🤔\
=> Tell me fast, I want to click on the "Create coin" button.🤧

calm down. you're freaking me out with these questions.
![Breathe in & Breathe out](/assets/What-the-hell-is-pump-dot-fun/iski-vehen-ka-masala-dosa.jpg)
***Breathe in & Breathe out***

Let me answer your questions one by one:

#### Q: Should I buy my token or not?

> => if you buy you your token it will provide initial liquidity to the trading pool. If you don't do this, the token may start with very low or no liquidity.\
> => if you don't buy then other traders won't put their trust as they see that the creator hasn't invested in it themselves.\
> => Would you buy someone's token even if they've not invested on their own token? if yes then go fuck yourself.

#### Q: what is the initial supply of token?

> => It is around 800 millions(as you can see in above image it's 793+ millions)

#### Q: How much should i buy?

[Note: not financial advice]\
> => It is really upto you how much you want to buy but it is said that buying some 6 SOL(don't trust me on this, i got this number from reddit) worth of token can help provide some initial liquidity and price stability.

#### Q: What if I buy all?

> => The whole game is of Demand and Supply. if you have all the supply then what's the demand. (*at least while launching the token*) if you've all the BTC then that might be different case as it will have high demand as you buy and price will go up but if people start loosing trust in BTC then people won't buy it and it's value will eventually decrease.\
> => so it would be better to buy some portion of supply and not all.Now I hope your all doubts are covered...

Then click on "Create Coin" focker.🚀

### What's next with my token

Now you might think that, I've created the token and baught 20% of that for my self now what?

pump.fun follows "some" process which determined what next will happend to your token. now what's that process?\
The process is simple, when people buy your token price go up and when people sell the token price goes down.(it works same as zerodha or binance) now when your token reaches certain market
cap(i.e. 69k dollars) then pump.fun will automatically close trading on your token and it will move your token to **Raydium**. Now as your token has moves to **Raydium** so this process of moving your token from **pump.fun** to **Raydium** is called *filling the bonding curve*.

Now you might ask what the fuck is **Bonding curve** and what is **Raydium**?\
![You're Good Question...](https://media1.tenor.com/m/OYEn73oxJOsAAAAC/good-question-you-are-a-good-question-deepak-dobriyal.gif)

#### Q: What is Raydium?
Raydium is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated market maker (AMM) built on the Solana blockchain.(and this is enough information for understanding this blog post)

now don't tell me you don't know what is **DEX** or **AMM**, if you don't know what is **DEX** then go watch [*Silicon Valley*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/) and if you don't know what is
**AMM** then go read [this blog post](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/amm-what-are-automated-market-makers#section-liquidity-pools-and-liquidity-providers).

Now we're ok?\
#### Q: What is Bonding curve?
A bonding curve is a mathematical model that defines the relationship between the price of a token and its supply.

*Again copied from the internet blah blah*
![Blahb blah blah](https://media1.tenor.com/m/sYCCQ6xLhtYAAAAd/friends-rachel-green.gif)
Now let's understand this so called *bonding curve* with an example which will be easy to understand.\
so if you're reading this that means you might know about what is bit coin and other some basic information about it.
> The basis of the bonding curve is the idea that when a person purchases an asset that is available in a limited quantity (like Bitcoin), then each subsequent buyer will have to pay slightly more for it. The reason for this increase in price is that the number of available asset units decreases with each one that is acquired. This mechanism should, supposedly, bring profits to the earliest investors.

// a lot of information needs to be covered... :(
