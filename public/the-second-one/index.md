I wrote a bit of JSX in my editor:

```js
<p className="text-2xl font-sans text-purple-400 dark:text-purple-500">
  Hello, <i>Alice</i>!
</p>
```

Right now, this information only exists on *my* device. But with a bit of luck, it will travel through time and space to *your* device, and appear on *your* screen.

```js eval
<p className="text-2xl font-sans text-purple-400 dark:text-purple-500">
  Hello, <i>Alice</i>!
</p>
```
